## Hydro Tasmania

This analysis looks at the frequency of extremely wet 14 day periods over the Hydro Tasmania catchments.

### April 1960

"Between 20th & 23rd, widespread flooding of all Tasmanian rivers, with the Macquarie, Elizabeth, Lake and Liffey rivers particularly affected. The greatest damage occurred in the New Norfolk area when over 250 mm of rain fell in less than 48 hours. At Macquarie Plains, 12 homes were destroyed. In Hobart, record losses were sustained through flooding of the Hobart Rivulet, with flooding a metre deep through some city streets. Flooding also extended throughout the East Coast and Midlands."

"Widespread and extreme flooding throughout the state occurred also in 1960, with the Macquarie, Elizabeth, Lake and Liffey Rivers particularly affected. Longford was isolated and families were evacuated at Ross and Liffey. Part of the Lake Highway bridge was carried away by a rapid river rise of 1 metre in 30 minutes. The Macquarie Plains-New Norfolk area saw the greatest damage with several people rescued from rooftops, twelve houses destroyed and an estimated 650 rendered homeless. Hobart sustained record losses estimated at Â£3 million as the Hobart Rivulet flooded. Water ran knee-high in Liverpool Street, and the Army was called to help in the rescue."

### June 1947

"In June 1947 the southern half of Tasmania was affected by its largest floods on record. Although flooding at its peak between 16 and 18 June affected almost all rivers and streams across the island, in the rest of the state, the flooding did not approach the extent of the better-known 1929 floods. Floods on rivers such as the Derwent and Huon were the largest on record and caused considerable damage."

### April 1929

"Between 4th and 6th, the most disasterous floods in northern and eastern Tasmania.

Fourteen lives lost owing to the bursting of the Briseis Dam on the Cascade River, and eight lives lost near Ulverstone when a motor truck plunged into the flooded Gawler River after the approaches to the bridge had been washed away.

The South Esk River rose to over 30' above the summer level at Fingal and to about 60' at Evandale, where it was 6' higher the the previous recorded flood of August 1852.

Considerable portions of the township of Longford and of the suburbs of Inveresk and Invermay and other low-lying parts of Launceston are flooded to a depth of upwards of 10'. Approx. 4,500 people in launceston were evacuated. The Duck reach electric power station and suspension bridge in Cataract Gorge is washed away.

The Macquarie River rises to over 14' above the summer level at Ross. The main road and railway is flooded between Tunbridge and Ross, at Claredon, and in the Evandale district. The railway is also badly damaged in other places, and is completely submerged at Rossbridge.

River west of Latrobe are in heavy flood, also with many road and railway bridges washed away.

In the south, the River Clyde rises to over 6' 6" at Hamilton. Flood waters from the River Styx are over the road at Bushy Park, and the Sorrel Creek has flooded the Hobart-New Norfolk road. In the Huon district, the Mountain River is in flood, whilst the Huon River puts 2' to 3' of water over the main road to Huonville. The Agnes Rivulet at Cygnet also overflows.

Noted bridges destroyed include the Perth and Scamander bridges; the railway bridges over the Forth, Blythe, and Black rivers (in the north west), the Claredon, Avoca, and Fingal bridges (in the north), and the Carlton River bridge at Dunalley in the south. Numerous other bridges are also damaged or destroyed. Stock losses and and property damage is also widespread."
